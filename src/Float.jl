function Float(cf::ContinuedFraction)
	#=
    Converts a cf to a float.

    Okay, this was something we apperenly only glanced the surface of
    all those years ago. This is actually something very cool.

    Consider a cf with orbit 2 [c1 c2 ;].

    Thus, x = 1/(c1 + 1/(c2 + x))
    Which equates to c1 x^2 + (c1c2 - 1)x + 1 - c2 = 0
    which is a quadratic equation.

    If fact, all of these setup quadratic equations to be solved.
    The problem is, the quadratic equations get nastier and nastier as the
    orbits increase.

    So that is not a feasible solution. (its a recurrence relation)
    So what we do instead is cheese it in a very unelegant manner

    head = [1 2 3 4]; orbit = [3 7]

    Here is the original documentation kept for nostalgiac purposes:

	Takes a continued fraction representing an irrational
	number and converts it to an irrational number.
	Remember, all irrational numbers have periodic continued fractions.

	There are two parts.. the first part is collapsing the cf.

	We have x = 1/(c[1] + 1/(cf[2] + 1/(cf[3] + x))
	for a cf with an orbit of 3.

	Once that is collapsed, it will give us
	x = (a1 + b1x)/(a2 + b2x)

	Which yields...
	b2x^2 + (a2 - b1)x - a1 = 0

	That can be solved using quadratic formula.
	We are only interested in the plus part of the answer.
