	Generate phi(n) for 1 .. n using some nifty properties:
	For m, b < n
		phi(mb) = phi(m)phi(b)*d/phi(d) where d = gcd(m,b)
			Note that when gcd(m,b) = 1 then phi(mb) = phi(m)phi(b)
			This is multiplicative property

		phi(2m) = 2phi(m) if m is even
		phi(2m) = phi(m) if m is odd

		# looks like this makes us slightly slower.
		phi(b^m) = b^(m-1)phi(b)

		BTW significantly slower to check if a is prime and set phi(a) as a - 1

		TODO TRY THIS:
		generate list of primes.
		Cycle through each prime p and use p - 1 and the tricks above.
		Then restart from the beginning and bruteforce/use tricks on what wasn't
		generated.

	So basically assign everything as 0. Run though and bruteforce
	everytime a 0 is encountered. Then figure out as many other easy values
	as we can using the properties above.
