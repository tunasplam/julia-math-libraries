    Continued fractions are cool. This was a lot of fun.
    We represent them with vectors as such:

    [1 2 3 4] = 1 + 1/(2+1/(3+(1/4)))

    a fun visualization function is the first function you can use here for fun.
=#

function visualize_cf(cf::Vector{Int})::String
    # This is one of the coolest things I have ever discovered.
    return join(cf, " + 1/(") * ")" ^ (length(cf) - 1)

        This is the function that i wrote down on that bus ride going
        over the grapevine to disneyland. My first year teaching, on a
        notepad, while everyone else was watching Dumb and Dumber.
        Here is the comment that was originally left:

            # Below all converted from python script for continued fractions written
            # on bus ride to disney land

        This is a lot of fun. Here is the original code:

            ```
                a, b = num, den
                cf = []
                while b != 0
                    # compute quotient and remainder
                    a = Int(numÃ·den)
                    b = num % den
                    # Append next part to continued fraction.
                    append!(cf, a)
                    # Shift over values for next iteration
                    num = den
                    den = b
                end
                return cf
            ```
    =#
    cf = []
    a, b = numerator(r), denominator(r)
    while b != 0
        append!(cf, a Ã· b)
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return cf
end

function cf_to_rational(cf::Vector{Int})::Rational
	#=
	Same as irrational but we don't have to worry about the formatting.
	This should always spit out a nice solution.
	Returns num // den AS A FRACTION (Rational)

	Note that the first value of cf is the whole part.
	=#

    @assert length(cf) > 0

    num = 1; den = cf[end]
	for i in length(cf)-1:-1:1
		# Keep adding and flipping. If you don't know whats going on
		# then work it out on paper.
		num += cf[i]*den

		temp = num
		num = den
		den = temp
	end

	# flipped one too many times so unflip here
	return den // num
end

function cf_to_float(cf::Vector; whole_part::Integer=0)::Float
	#=
	Takes a continued fraction representing an irrational
	number and converts it to an irrational number.
	Remember, all irrational numbers have periodic continued fractions.

	There are two parts.. the first part is collapsing the cf.

	We have x = 1/(c[1] + 1/(cf[2] + 1/(cf[3] + x))
	for a cf with an orbit of 3.

	Once that is collapsed, it will give us
	x = (a1 + b1x)/(a2 + b2x)

	Which yields...
	b2x^2 + (a2 - b1)x - a1 = 0

	That can be solved using quadratic formula.
	We are only interested in the plus part of the answer.

	TODO
	HAS NOT BEEN TESTED THOROUGHLY.
    TODO i completely borked this
	=#

	# numerator constant and coefficient of x
	a1 = 1
    b1 = 0
	# denominator constant and coefficient of x
	a2 = cf[end]
    b2 = 1
	for i in length(cf)-1:-1:1
		a1 = cf[i]*a2 + a1
        b1 = cf[i]*b2 + b1
		
		# flip the fraction over by swapping
		temp = a1
		a1 = a2
		a2 = temp
		temp = b1
		b1 = b2
		b2 = temp
	end

	# set up and solve our quadratic equation.
    # TODO this algo seems to require the below function to have a specific
    # return style... but it does no longer. That is why i added testing :)
	result = solve_quadratic(b2, a2-b1, -a1, formatted=true, sol_type="plus")

	# Whole part, add it to the result. So result[1] will increase
	# by whole_part*result[2]
	if whole_part > 0
		result[1] = whole_part*result[2]
	end
	return result
end
