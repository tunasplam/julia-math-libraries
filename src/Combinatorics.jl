function C(n::Integer, k::Integer)::Integer
    #=
        Calculate nCr without any modular arithmetic.
        https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.html#improved-implementation

        NOTE if you need to use lots of small Combinations
        it would probably be better to precompute and cache
        the factorial values. Then the calculations of each nCr
        will be O(1)

        NOTE if you need lots of small Combinations it could also
        be better to stash these in a lookup table generated using
        Pascal's Theorem (basically, generate the triangle).

function C_mod_m(n::Integer, k::Integer, m::Integer)::Integer
    #=

        Use this:
        https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.html#binomial-coefficient-modulo-an-arbitrary-number

        Requires CRT implementation.
        TODO we have not used this yet because for now all we need
        is C_mod_prime.

function C_mod_prime_p(n::Integer, k::Integer, p::Integer)::Integer
    #=
        Calculate nCr % p where p is prime.
        https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.html#binomial-coefficient-modulo-large-prime
    
        To derive this formula, simply take the definition of nCr and
        mod both sides. Then rewrite the fraction using modular inverses.

        NOTE if you are going to use this multiple times then you want to cache the
        values of factorial_mod_m up to the maximum input value n.
        
        So you should implement this function custom everytime you use it. Refer
        to an array `factorial` that is primed at the beginning with:

        ```
        factorial_mod_p = ones(Int, max_n)
        for i in 2:max_n
            factorial_mod_p[i] = factorial_mod_p[i-1] * i % p
        end
        ```

        NOTE above is O(max_n). Combining with the code in this functino
        and no other caching gies O(log p) time

        NOTE if you need factorial[0] then use those cool offset arrays.
    
        NOTE computation of binomial coefficient can be down to O(1)
        if you precompute values of inverses of factorials.
        To do so (using cache factorial_mod_p above):

        ```
        inverse_factorial = ones(Int, max_n)
        inverse_factorial_mod_p[1] = modular_inverse(factorial_mod_p[1], p)
        for i in 2:max_n
            inverse_factorial[i] = modular_inverse(factorial_mod_p[i], p)
        end
        ```

        NOTE here is the above two cleaned up significantly. See p788
        to see this in action.

        ```
        factorial_mod_p = ones(Int, N)
        inverse_factorial_mod_p = ones(Int, N)
        inverse_factorial_mod_p[1] = modular_inverse(factorial_mod_p[1], p)
        for i in 2:N
            factorial_mod_p[i] = factorial_mod_p[i-1] * i % p
            inverse_factorial_mod_p[i] = modular_inverse(factorial_mod_p[i], p)
        end
        ```
    =#

    # NOTE you can get a performance boost if you can guarantee k > 0

    if k < 0
        return 0
    end

    # NOTE you can disable this if you can guarantee that p is prime
    # to get a speedup.
    @assert is_prime(p)

    # here is an implementation without any caching.
    # NOTE do not combine the modular inverses here with multiplication

    return factorial_mod(n, p) * modular_inverse(factorial_mod(k, p), p) * modular_inverse(factorial_mod(n-k, p), p) % p

mutable struct Iterate_Combinations
    #=
    Iterate through all of the ways you can choose k indicies from
    n elements for k = 0:n. Represented as a bitstring of length n with k 1's
    and (n-k) 0's.

    iterate through these
        ..00000
        ..00001
        ..00010
        ..00101
        ...

        The idea is to iterate through 1:2^n and return
        each binary representation as a string.

        the sole argument is n which is the amount of digits to consider.
    =#

    n::Integer

end

# this starts off the iterator by instantiating the struct with 
# index 1 and n digits to consider

# we always start iterating from 1, that is why index=1
function Base.iterate(C::Iterate_Combinations, index=1)
    # checks for the stop condition
    # we want index â‰¤ 2^n
    if index > 2^C.n
        return nothing
    end

    # represent index as bitstring and grab the rightmost n digits
    # yield the new value and the new index
    return bitstring(index)[end-(C.n-1):end], index + 1
