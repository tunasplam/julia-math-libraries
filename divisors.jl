#=  Theorem 6-1 on page 104 of our number theory book
  has a beautiful algorithm that we can use

 Going to test it against our other divisor algorithm to 
 check for speed.

TODO: Sum of divisors in problem 23 solutions. Look at alvaro's code
suposedly theres a nice explanation somewhere on mathschallenge.net as well.
https://mathschallenge.net/index.php?section=faq&ref=number/sum_of_divisors
see p153.jl for implementation

#=
	TODO Make this a function:
	For a number n, count how many times some prime p will be a prime factor of all
	numbers <= n.
	Call it C(n, p)

	So C(39, 3) = 18 since 3 appears 18 times when writing out the prime
	factorizations of all numbers <= 39.

	Here is the algorithm:

	C(n,p)
	x, count = 0, 0
	m = floor( log_p n )
	for i in 1:m
		count += i * (floor( n / p^i) - x)
		x = floor( n / p^i )

	turns into the nice summation equation:
	C(n, p) = sum_{1}^{floor(log_p n)} = i * ( floor(n/p^i) - floor(n^{p^i+1}) )
