	As the title implies.
	So for 11! = 39916800 returns 99168

	How it works:
	Every time a 5 appears in the prime factorization of i then a zero is added
	so for 25 = 5^2 2 fives are added.
	
	Then mod 10^k

	This is too slow. ! 80s for 10^10 and we need 10^12.
	There has to be another way.

	64704
	So yeah n = 10^9 = 64704 isnt even right. might punt.
	should be 38144

	A mouthful but an interesting algorithm I guess.

	- Find prime factorization of n
	- For each prime factor p with power r,
	  find the lowest k_i s.t. p_i^r_i | (k_i)!
	- The answer for n is going to be the max of the k's
	  found in the previous step.

	TODO combine with our factorial_mod_k generator to
	get an upper bound on how high you need to generate until
	0's are reached.
	ALSO use that to verify these findings! I am pretty certain
	that this is a project euler problem!
