	O Check the answer thread for problem 66 if you need more speed.
	There is an interesting algorithm there where one does not even need
	to calculate the numerators/denominators of the continued fraction,
	they just calculate the length of the sequence.

function solve_pell_equation(D, num_solutions)
	#=
	Per wikipedia article on pell equations:

	"If a is the period of the continued fraction and c_k = p_k/q_k is the
	kth convergent, all solutions to the Pell equation are in the form
	(p_ia, q_ia) for all i in the positive integers."

	What does that mean? Well, first we need to find the period of the
	continued fraction. In the example below, the period of sqrt(3) is
	2,1 (note that in this case the period is NOT referring to the length
	of the pattern, but rather to the pattern ITSELF).

	The convergents are the portions of the infinite extended fraction that
	are truncated after every period.

	For example, for sqrt(3) = [1; 1, 2,1, 2,1, ... ]

	To generate the convergents:
	keep calculating
	[1; 1, 2,1]				=> 7/4    = p_1   /	q_1
	[1; 1, 2,1, 2,1]		=> 26/15  = p_1*2 / q_1*2
	[1; 1, 2,1, 2,1, 2,1]	=> 97/56  = p_2*2 / q_2*2
	& etc.

	So, we will need a function that generates the convergent fraction to
	a desireable limit and then this function will parse the periods.

	TODO look at 1st solution for D = 2. Theres an issue where it says
	1 // 1 is the solution but this is not the right answer.
	TODO check for square values of D.

	Returns list of fractions where each fraction is

function solve_general_pell_equation(D, N, num_solutions)
	#=
	For context see problem 138
	I will never sleep. This can be made into a general pell equation.

	See the "Generalized Pell's equation" heading below.
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation#The_smallest_solution_of_Pell_equations
	
	Idea behind creating the pell equation:

	Pythagorean theorem creates this situation:

	(b/2)^2 + (b +- 1)^2 = L^2

	Solving for L gives a situation where we are interested in when
	5/4*b^2 + 2b + 1 is an integer (when it equals d^2 for some int d).

	Complete the square to make this new equation into the form

	(5b + 4)^2 - 20d^2 = -4
	which can be rewritten as
	c^2 - 20d^2 = -4 for some int c, a general pell equation of the form
	x^2 - dy^2 = N

	Note that
	e^2 - 20f^2 = 1 is the corresponding pell resolvant.

	There exists the multiplicative principle, namely:
	if (c_0, d_0) is a solution to c^2 - 20d^2 = -4 (the seed?)
	and (e_0, f_0) is a solution to e^2 - 20f^2 = 1 (its seed)
	then (c_n, d_n) is a solution to c^2 - 20d^2 = -4 where
	c_n + d_n*sqrt(20) = (c_0+d_0*sqrt(20))*(e_n+f_n*sqrt(20))

	This might rely on the fact that |N| < sqrt(20)
	i.e. |-4| < sqrt(20)

	So what do we do?
	- Find a seed solution to the general equation (use a graph I guess)
	- Find a seed solution to the resolvant.
	- Iterate through the resolvant using the convergents of sqrt of 20
	  and use them to generate solutions to resolvant.
	- Use solution from the resolvant and seed to general equation to find
	  the corresponding solution to the general equation.

	But first, confirm that our continued fraction methods will work for
	square root of 20

	This is a GREAT oppirtunity to modulize all our topical files.

	So found the continued fraction for sqrt(20) to be [4; 2, 8]
	with 2, 8 being the orbit.

	The first convergent of sqrt(20) is 9/2 meaning
	e_0 = 9 and f_0 = 2 is our seed solution of the resolvant.

	Going to do basic brute force to find seed solution of our general
	pell equation.
	Got c_0 = 4, d_0 = 1. Is this a degenerate triangle?

	Relate back to the original problem to find out.
	c = 5b +- 4 means b = (c - 4)/5
	c = 4 makes b = 0 so YES degenerate.
