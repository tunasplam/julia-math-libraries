	#=
	S set of values. sort them big to small.

	Note that the partitions are PRINTED as they are finalized.
	returns "1" if successful. Dunno if its even necessary.

	An algorithm that has been eluding us that may unlock so many solutions,
	yet finally may have figured it out.

	Note that for now this only works if 1 is in S (and it may be faster
	that way so if we make another function that works if 1 is not in the set
	then we should keep a method on hand specially for if 1 is in S)

	Basically, think of n as a bunch of ones.
	Take as big of a bite as you can and keep doing that until you cannot bite
	anymore.
	Then go back one step, take one bite smaller and continue onward.
	So for n = 5, S = {3, 2, 1} visualize like this:

	1   1   1 | 1   1
	1   1   1 | 1 | 1
	1   1 | 1   1 | 1
	1   1 | 1 | 1 | 1
	1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

	It is important to note that no bite can be larger than a preceding bite.
	So if the first bite was 2, you cannot bite for more than 2 the rest of the
	iteration (the third row exemplifies this, could not take a bite of 3 after
	first taking a bite of 2).

	Note:
		- for S = [n:1], this makes partitions where order of partition
		  does not matter.

	TODO MAKE THIS AN ITERATOR!
	For the iterator, hold the list of strings in the struct. That will make it
	easy. You're still passing an object each method call though. There would
	probably be MORE overhead this way!

	NOTE NOTE NOTE HOW TO MAKE THIS ITERATOR? THIS IS:
	SLOANE'S A000607
	a(n) = 1/n*Sum_{k=1..n} A008472*a(n-k)
	where A008472 is the sum of the distinct primefactors of k!!
	USE THIS FOR PROBLEM 169 I BET SOMEHOW.
