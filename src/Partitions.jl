    Partition function P

    Gives all the ways that integer n can be written as
    the sum of positive integers where the order of the
    addends is not considered significant.
=#

using OffsetArrays

function partition_function_p(n::Integer)::Vector{Int}
    #=
    OEIS A000041

    Returns the first n of the partition function P for n = 1, 2, ..

    Uses Euler's recurrence equation which is found as equation
    11 in the Mathworld link below.

    # this shifts the index left 1
